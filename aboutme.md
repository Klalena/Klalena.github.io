   I am a student pursuing [MS in Interdisciplinary Data Science](https://datascience.duke.edu/) at Duke University with academic background in Business Administration and Economics and professional experience in finance.  I decided to pursue data science because I like to be challenged, enjoy continuous learning, and love to see the impact of data-driven decisions. 
   
   **My Thoughts re Data Science:** In the era of big data, data is no longer a scarce resource as it used to be. What's scarce is the ability to turn data into something *useful*. That's where data science comes in. I like to compare a data scientist to a chef. A chef who can make a nutritious and flavourful dinner from multiple random ingredients and knows how to deliver it. I aspire to be that chef. What about you?
