   I am a Master's student pursuing MS in [Interdisciplinary Data Science](https://datascience.duke.edu/) at Duke University. In the era of big data, data is no longer a scarce resource as it used to be. What's scarce is the ability to turn data into something *useful*. That's where data science comes in. I decided to pursue data science because it allows for better data-driven decisions and enable them to answer more questions. 

   I like to compare a data scientist to a chief who can make a nutritious and flavourful dinner from multiple random row ingredients and knows how to deliver it. I aspire to be that chief.
