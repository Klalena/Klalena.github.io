   I am a Master's student pursuing [MS in Interdisciplinary Data Science](https://datascience.duke.edu/) at Duke University. In the era of big data, data is no longer a scarce resource as it used to be. What's scarce is the ability to turn data into something *useful*. That's where data science comes in. I decided to pursue data science because it can make data valuable, leading to better data-driven decisions. 

   I like to compare a data scientist to a chef. A chef who can make a nutritious and flavourful dinner from multiple random ingredients and knows how to deliver it. I aspire to be that chef.
