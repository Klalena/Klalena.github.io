In this post, I will explore a few insightful trends of Malaria worldwide from 2010 to 2015 using data from [Our World in Data](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2018/2018-11-13). I will utilize the beauty and effectiveness of interactive visualizations created with `Plotly` and `pandas_bokeh`  in Python to illustrate how the number of malaria cases and  deaths changed through time and what  age and income groups succeeded the most in  the fight against malaria. 

## About [Malaria](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/malaria)

Malaria is a disease caused by *Plasmodium* parasites, which is mostly transmitted  by mosquitoes (infected female *Anopheles* mosquitoes). Even though malaria is a curable and preventable disease,  it can be fatal when not diagnosed early and  treated properly. The distribution  of malaria cases and deaths vary greatly among geographic regions and age groups.  The majority of cases and deaths are found in the African region ([> 93% as of 2018]((https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/malaria))), where children under 5 years old are the most susceptible age group to contract and die from malaria. According to the World Health Organization, in 2018 alone there were more than 200 million malaria cases and  more than 400 thousand deaths worldwide. Although these numbers are alarming, they are significantly lower than they were a decade ago, which mainly can be attributed to the WHO Malaria Elimination initiative, rigorous nationwide  policies on malaria treatment and prevention, and the vaccine against malaria.
