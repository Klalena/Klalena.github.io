In today's competitive world, more and more people enroll in doctorate programs in the US. To explore some trends of doctorate recipients over time, I have decided to analyze data of [PhDs awarded in the US](https://ncses.nsf.gov/pubs/nsf19301/data) from the National Science Foundation. Some of the questions that I was interested in exploring are as follows: 

- What field of study pays the highest? How it varies depending if employment is in academia, government, industry, or nonprofit organization? 
- Do particular fields of studies attract more international students? What is the trend through time? Is it because of the higher payoff in that field? ðŸ¤”
- What are the top countries of origin of international students? 

To answer these questions, I have created an interactive [dashboard](https://share.streamlit.io/klalena/dashboard_on_phd_data/main/app.py) with Streamlit. I will leave it up to you to explore.
