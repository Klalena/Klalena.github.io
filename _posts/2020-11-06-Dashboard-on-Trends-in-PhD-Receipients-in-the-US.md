In today's competitive world, more and more people enroll in doctorate programs in the US. Some of the questions that I was interested in exploring are as follows: 

- What field of study pays the highest? How it varies depending if employment is in academia, government, industry, or nonprofit organization? 
- Do particular fields of studies attract more international students? What is the trend through time? Is it because of the higher payoff in that field? ðŸ¤”
- What are the top countries of origin of international students? 

To answer these question, I have created an interactive dashboard. I will leave it up to you to explore.
