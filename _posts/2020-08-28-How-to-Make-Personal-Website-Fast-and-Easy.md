A personal website is a great tool to showcase your projects and blog about topics that you are passionate about. Unfortunately, there is a misconception that making a personal website is a painful, time-consuming, and costly process. Consequently, this prevents many talented people from sharing their scientific/art projects with employers and the world. This tutorial proves the opposite, guiding you step by step on how to create a free and elegant website (like this one) in hours if not minutes!  Without further ado, let's get started.

**Key ingridients**: GitHub, Beaitiful Jekyll, and your creativity. 

## Step I: Open GitHub Account 
If you don' have one, you wil need to sign up [here](https://github.com/). GitHub is a free version control tool that let you host one static website through GitHub Pages, which will be used for this tutorial. 

## Step II: Fork Beautiful-Jekyll Repository (repo)
Fork [Beautiful-Jekyll project](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll/) by clicking on *Fork* as shown below:

Once you have this repo, you will have all it needs to make a simple yet elegant website. 

## Step III: Rename your repository 
The next step is to rename the forked repo from Beautiful-Jekyll to **yourusername.github.io** . For this, you need to click on setting and rename the repo as shown below:

This will create a website with the Beautiful-Jekyll template with the following address: `<https://yourusername.github.io]>`. 

⚠️ Please note that you need to use your GitHub username when renaming the forked repo. If you don't, you will end up having a long website name. For example, if you name your repository as **mycoolproject/github.io** , you will get this long address: `<https://yourusername.github.io/mycoolproject/github.io>` -- believe me, it's not pleasing to the eye. 

## Step IV: You've got it -- just style it 

Congratulations! You've just created your own website. Indeed, it was not that bad. Now, you just need to style it.
