This post will show how to store Spotify data in the Third Normal Form (3NF) using SQLite. For a  database to be in 3NF, it needs to be in  2NF (with no partial dependence),  and there should not be any transitive relationships between non-prime attributes. In other words, 3NF means that one non-prime attribute cannot be inferred by another non-prime attribute. So, each attribute in the table depends only on the primary key. If you are unfamiliar with normalization, there are many good tutorials. Why not start with [this one](https://www.edureka.co/blog/normalization-in-sql/)?

Why is it important that the data is stored in 3NF? It is common to store data in a relational database in 3NF because it minimizes unnecessary duplication of data, helps to avoid modification anomalies when inserting, deleting, or updating tuples, and simplifies queries. 

## Normalization of Spotify Data

[Spotify data](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-01-21/readme.md) has 23 columns and it is already in the 1st Normal Form as can be seen from the sample of data below. 

```python
data.shape
```

```python
(32833, 23)
```

```python
data.columns
```

```python
Index(['track_id', 'track_name', 'track_artist', 'track_popularity',
       'track_album_id', 'track_album_name', 'track_album_release_date',
       'playlist_name', 'playlist_id', 'playlist_genre', 'playlist_subgenre',
       'danceability', 'energy', 'key', 'loudness', 'mode', 'speechiness',
       'acousticness', 'instrumentalness', 'liveness', 'valence', 'tempo',
       'duration_ms'],
      dtype='object')
```

|      |               track_id |                                        track_name | track_artist | track_popularity |
| ---: | ---------------------: | ------------------------------------------------: | -----------: | ---------------: |
|    0 | 6f807x0ima9a1j3VPbc7VN | I Don't Care (with Justin Bieber) - Loud Luxur... |   Ed Sheeran |               66 |
|    1 | 0r7CVbZTWZgbTCYdfa2P31 |                   Memories - Dillon Francis Remix |     Maroon 5 |               67 |
|    2 | 1z1Hg7Vb0AhHDiEmnDE79l |                   All the Time - Don Diablo Remix | Zara Larsson |               70 |

As can be seen from the data above, there are several themes (e.g., tracks, albums, and playlists), and each of them can be saved in several separate tables.  For the relational database to be in 3NF, each attribute in the table should depend only on the primary key. This is not true in the current state of Spotify data. After normalization, I ended up with 9 tables. For more details on how and why these tables were created, please see my code [here](https://github.com/Klalena/BIOS823-Statistical_Programming-for-Big-Data/blob/master/Homework/Spotify_DB_Normalization.ipynb).

Here is a simple ER diagram of the normalized SQLite database for Spotify data:

## Fom Pandas DataFrames to SQLite Database

First, I saved the above-noted tables as pandas DataFrames. For example, let's take a look at how the`album` table was created. 

```python
data = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-01-21/spotify_songs.csv')

album = data.iloc[:, [4,6]].drop_duplicates()
album.head(3)
```



|      |         track_album_id | track_album_release_date |
| ---: | ---------------------: | -----------------------: |
|    0 | 2oCs0DGTsRO98Gh5ZSl2Cx |               2019-06-14 |
|    1 | 63rPSO264uRjW1X5E6cWv6 |               2019-12-13 |
|    2 | 1HoSmj2eLcsrR0vE9gThr4 |               2019-07-05 |

The next step was to convert pandas DataFrames in SQLite database, which is done with `sqlite3` as follows: 

```python
import sqlite3

#connect to the database
conn = sqlite3.connect('spotify.db')
c = conn.cursor()

#list of tables (DataFrames)
tables = [track, track_name, album, album_name, playlist_name, playlist, track_album, track_playlist, album_playlist]
#names of the tables
tables_names = ['track', 'track_name', 'album', 'album_name', 'playlist_name', 'playlist', 'track_album', 'track_playlist', 'album_playlist']

#convert each table to SQl 
for i, df in enumerate(tables):
    df.to_sql(tables_names[i], con = conn, index = False, if_exists='replace')

```

Now, let's see what tables we have in `spotify.db`:

```python
c.execute(  
"""
SELECT name
FROM sqlite_master
WHERE type = 'table'
""")
#list the names of the tables in the databse
c.fetchall()
```

```python
[('track',),
 ('track_name',),
 ('album',),
 ('album_name',),
 ('playlist_name',),
 ('playlist',),
 ('track_album',),
 ('track_playlist',),
 ('album_playlist',)]
```

All 9 tables are in SQLite database in 3NF! 

And here is how I generated the ER diagram: 

```python
#create ER diagram 
import os 
from eralchemy import render_er

render_er('sqlite:///spotify.db', 'spotify_er.png', mode = 'graph')
```

Finally, we are ready to run SQL queries on our normalized SQL database!

## What Are the Names of  Playlists that Contain Instrumentals?

First, let's see how many unique playlists there are that contain instrumentals, where instrumental means that the song has no vocals and has above 0.5 value in the `instrumentalness` column.

```python
from pandas import DataFrame

#connect to the database
conn = sqlite3.connect('spotify.db')
c = conn.cursor()

#execute sql query 
c.execute ("""
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT playlist_name)
FROM playlist_name AS p 
LEFT JOIN track_playlist AS tp
    ON p.playlist_id = tp.playlist_id
LEFT JOIN track AS t
    ON tp.track_id = t.track_id
WHERE t.instrumentalness > 0.5
""")
#fetch resultset and save it as DataFrame 
DataFrame(c.fetchall())
```

|      |    0 |
| ---: | ---: |
|    0 |  256 |

There are 256 unique playlists containing instrumentals. 

Next, let's take a look at 10 playlists ordered in ascending order: 

```python
c.execute ("""
SELECT DISTINCT playlist_name
FROM playlist_name AS p 
JOIN track_playlist AS tp
    ON p.playlist_id = tp.playlist_id
JOIN track AS t
    ON tp.track_id = t.track_id
WHERE t.instrumentalness > 0.5
ORDER BY playlist_name 
LIMIT 10
""")

playlists_inst = DataFrame(c.fetchall(), columns = ['Playlist Name'])
playlists_inst
```



|      |                                 Playlist Name |
| ---: | --------------------------------------------: |
|    0 |                              "Permanent Wave" |
|    1 |                                 10er Playlist |
|    2 |                              2000's hard rock |
|    3 |                               2011-2014 House |
|    4 |                       2019 in Indie Poptimism |
|    5 | 2020 Hits & 2019 Hits â€“ Top Global Tracks ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ |
|    6 |                            3rd Coast Classics |
|    7 |                             70's Classic Rock |
|    8 |                                 70s Hard Rock |

Hmmm, 70's Hard Rock ðŸŽ¸... What are some of the instrumental songs in that playlist?

```python
c.execute("""
SELECT playlist_name, track_name,track_artist, instrumentalness
FROM track AS t 
LEFT JOIN track_name as tn
    ON t.track_id = tn.track_id
LEFT JOIN track_playlist as tp
    ON tp.track_id = t.track_id 
LEFT JOIN playlist_name AS pn 
    ON pn.playlist_id = tp.playlist_id
WHERE playlist_name LIKE '70s Hard Rock'
ORDER BY instrumentalness DESC
LIMIT 7
""")
hardrock = pd.DataFrame(c.fetchall(), columns = ['Playlist Name', 'Track', 'Track Artist','Instrumentalness'])
hardrock
```



|      | Playlist Name |                                           Track | Track Artist | Instrumentalness |
| ---: | ------------: | ----------------------------------------------: | -----------: | ---------------: |
|    0 | 70s Hard Rock |                                        Majestic |      Journey |            0.923 |
|    1 | 70s Hard Rock | Won't Get Fooled Again - Original Album Version |      The Who |            0.867 |
|    2 | 70s Hard Rock |                                        Parasite |         KISS |            0.798 |
|    3 | 70s Hard Rock |                                       Chinatown |   Thin Lizzy |            0.744 |
|    4 | 70s Hard Rock |            Lights Out - 2008 Remastered Version |          UFO |            0.731 |
|    5 | 70s Hard Rock |                                    Heartbreaker |         Free |            0.707 |
|    6 | 70s Hard Rock |                      Rockin' All Over The World |   Status Quo |            0.491 |

Indeed, several tracks score high in `instrumentalness`. For example, the [Majestic song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lifsbJ35j8s) without a word is majestically instrumental!
